Hello!

This is the game "Dots" but made on a hexagonal grid.
I also made a bonus game using the same rules because I really wanted to reward the player for creating loops containing hexes.

I had a lot of fun making it, and hope you have some fun playing it.

HOW TO PLAY:
Upon opening you will be greeted with a plethora of options.
COLORS: how many different colors you are playing with [CUSTOM has a max of 3 colors, so making the slider go higher than 3 will have no effect]
ROWS: how many rows you are playing with
COLUMNS: how many columns you are playing with
GAME MODE:
  DOTS: basic game mode, exactly what the prompt was
  CUSTOM: my game mode [rules below]
EASY LOOPS:
  ON: a loop can consist of >=3 hexes, just as long as you connect back somewhere on your path
  OFF: a loop has to completely encompass at least 1 other hex
MOBILE FRIENDLY:
  ON: when you start a path, the camera zooms in on your path, making it a bit easier to play on mobile devices or if you want to play on a really big board
  OFF: camera is fixed the whole time [definitely recommend this if playing on a computer]

Press START to play the game with the configuration you made

RULES OF PLAY:
DOTS:
1) 1 pt per hex cleared
2) click on hex to start a path, drag with mouse down to adjacent hexes to make path longer, you can only drag to hexes of the same color
3) form a loop to clear all hexes of the loop's color
4) you are a wizard making constellations in the sky
CUSTOM
1) each hex you connect is 1 pt.
2) +1 (+ 3 if path > 3) point if you end your path where you started
3) when you make a loop, +5 for each different type of hex inside the loop
4) you are a wizard terraforming the world around you
